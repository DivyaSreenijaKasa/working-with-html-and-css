# Personal Webpage – First HTML Project 🌸

This is my very first HTML & CSS activity, created after learning the basics from IBM’s Master Classes. Built and tested in VS Code, this webpage introduces who I am, what I’m learning, and how others can connect with me.

## 📌 Features
- ✨ Simple design focused on clarity
- 📖 “About Me” section with a brief intro
- 💡 Highlights my technical skills and current learning goals
- 🔗 Includes a link to my GitHub profile
- 📬 Contact form for visitors to reach out

## 🚧 What’s Next
I plan to style the page with CSS and add more interactive elements in future updates. Stay tuned!
